Experience
</h2>

<h3>
Space Telescope Science Institute / IT Division<br />
Senior Software Developer 2001-2014
</h3>

<p>Supported the Space Telescope Institute and astronomical community
through developing web applications, implementing new products in
Zope, the Python based content management system, and adding user
requested enhancements to the Institute web site.</p>

<ul>
<li>Debugged and patched problems with Zope Python internals, a
complex and poorly documented code base.</li>

<li>Made user requested changes to web site content, writing HTML,
CSS, and Javascript to handle their requests.</li>

<li>Developed application to collect conflict of interest reports and
store them in MySQL database for administrative review. The
application was delivered bug free, no users reported problems after
delivery.</li>

<li>Part of team that wrote performance appraisal reporting
application in Java. Required encoding complex business logic about
who could view and edit appraisals and appraisal state transitions as
Java classes.</li>

<li>Migrated the content of one Wiki to another by writing a parser to
convert the data format. This significantly reduced migration time
from Zope to Confluence.</li>

<li>Added telescope performance metrics and their associated metadata
to the web site through a Perl program, allowing astronomers to view
telescope behavior over time.</li>

<li>Modified Zope IP address handling to handle subnet masking after
Institute address range had been reduced to require it.</li>

<li>Generated nightly a photo gallery of Institute employees organized
by department. It was produced by a Perl program from information
stored in LDAP and Active Directory.</li>

<li>Developed web based phone directory application to search Active
Directory for employees. One of the most widely used pages on the
site.</li>

<li>Kept astronomers informed of current research by writing web
scraping script to report when their Institute astronomers had
uploaded preprints to Arxiv.</li>

<li>Kept website links current by writing link checking
application. It parsed Apache log files, scraped curators web page,
doubled checked the errors, and emailed curators about them.</li>

<li>Supported and enhanced the Institute conference registration tool,
resolving problems that arose during Institute conferences.</li>

<li>Performed code reviews to assess other employees' software for
security vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
