Experience
</h2>

<h3>
Space Telescope Science Institute / IT Division<br />
Senior Software Developer 2001-2014
</h3>

<p>Supported Space Telescope Institute and astronomical community
through web application development, new products implementation in
Zope, the Python based content management system, and adding
user-requested enhancements to Institute web site.</p>

<ul>
<li>Supported Institute website by debugging and patching problems
with Zope Python internals, a complex and poorly documented code
base.</li>

<li>Handled user requested changes to website content by writing HTML,
CSS, and Javascript, meeting user needs.</li>

<li>Developed application that collected conflict of interest reports
and stored them in MySQL database for administrative review,
delivering application bug free, with no users reporting problems
after delivery.</li>

<li>Wrote performance appraisal reporting application in Java with
team members, requiring encoding complex business logic about who
could view and edit appraisals and appraisal state transitions as Java
classes.</li>

<li>Reduced migration time from Zope to Confluence by transferring
content of one Wiki to another by writing a parser that converted data
format.</li>

<li>Added telescope performance metrics and associated metadata to
website through Perl program, allowing astronomers to view telescope
behavior over time.</li>

<li>Solved problem caused by reduction in Institute IP address range
by modifying Zope address handling to support subnet masking.</li>

<li>Generated photo gallery of Institute employees organized by
department on a nightly basis, produced by a Perl program from
information stored in LDAP and Active Directory.</li>

<li>Developed web-based phone directory application that searched
Active Directory for employees, becoming one of the most widely used
pages on site.</li>

<li>Kept astronomers informed of current research by writing
web-scraping script that reported when Institute astronomers had
uploaded preprints to Arxiv.</li>

<li>Maintained status of website links by writing link-checking
application, which parsed Apache log files and curatorsÂ’
webpage. Double-checked errors, emailing curators about them.</li>

<li>Supported and enhanced conference registration tool, resolving
problems during Institute conferences.</li>

<li>Performed code reviews, assessing other employees' software for
security vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Space Telescope Science Institute / Scientific Software Group<br />
Software Developer
</h3>

<p>Wrote applications and libraries supporting data files and formats
used by astronomical community to store and process observation
data.</p>

<uL>

<li>Added calibration files to database by assisting with designing
and writing Calibration Database system, including C code.</li>

<li>Initialized user environment for using astronomical software by
writing bash scripts and installing new software versions.</li>

<li>Wrote statistics package for astronomers, converting a
statistician's code into production quality code. Package allowed
astronomers to analyze data that was incomplete because of telescope
performance limits.</li>

<li>Designed and wrote synthetic photometry (synphot) package, a large
software package widely used by astronomers to plan proposed telescope
observations.</li>
</ul>
