- Reduced migration time from Zope to Confluence by transferring content of one Wiki to another by writing a parser that converted data format.
- Added telescope performance metrics and associated metadata to website through Perl program, allowing astronomers to view telescope behavior over time.
- Solved problem caused by reduction in Institute IP address range by modifying Zope address handling to support subnet masking.
- Generated photo gallery of Institute employees organized by department on a nightly basis, produced by a Perl program from information stored in LDAP and Active Directory.
- Developed web-based phone directory application that searched Active Directory for employees, becoming one of the most widely used pages on site.

- Added calibration files to database by assisting with designing and writing Calibration Database system, including C code.
- Initialized user environment for using astronomical software by writing bash scripts and installing new software versions.
- Wrote statistics package for astronomers, converting a statistician's code into production quality code. Package allowed astronomers to analyze data that was incomplete because of telescope performance limits.
- Designed and wrote synthetic photometry (synphot) package, a large software package widely used by astronomers to plan proposed telescope observations.
