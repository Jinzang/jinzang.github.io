<p>I'm Bernie Simon. The free software I've working on can be found
here on <a href="https://github.com/Jinzang">GitHub</a>. Some can also
be downloaded
from <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/JINZANG">CPAN.</a> The
software I have written was used to build this site. I created it with
<a href="https://github.com/Jinzang/App-Followme">followme</a>, a
static site generator I wrote as an alternative to Jekyll.

<h3>Plans For Followme</h3>


<p><a href="https://github.com/Jinzang/App-Followme">Followme</a> is the github
project I've been working on the most over the past several
months. I'm going to put it on hold for a while and turn to several
other projects. But just for the record, here is what I would like to
work on when I return to it. First, there needs to be more
documentation. The idea of a prototype and how it differs from a
template is something that needs explaining, as I haven't seen anyone
else using prototypes. Second, I'd like to add a photo gallery
module. I started work on one, but it's not finished. Third, I'd like
to expand the use of metadata variables. The usefulness of the
CreateIndex module depends on good metadata, such as author. Right now
there's no code to read metadata from binary files or html files and I
would like to add that. Right now the version of followme is one fix
ahead of the version on CPAN. It adds the filename to the error
message in one case where it was missing. If I don't come up with any
other fixes soon, I'll create another CPAN release before putting
followme to rest for a while.</p>
