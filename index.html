Experience
</h2>

<h3>
Space Telescope Science Institute / IT Division<br />
Senior Software Developer 2001-2014
</h3>

<p>Supported Space Telescope Institute and astronomical community
through web application development, new products implementation in
Zope, the Python based content management system, and adding
user-requested enhancements to Institute web site.</p>

<ul>
<li>Supported Institute website by debugging and patching problems
with Zope Python internals, a complex and poorly documented code
base.</li>

<li>Handled user requested changes to website content by writing HTML,
CSS, and Javascript, meeting user needs.</li>

<li>Developed application that collected conflict of interest reports
and stored them in MySQL database for administrative review,
delivering application bug free, with no users reporting problems
after delivery.</li>

<li>Wrote performance appraisal reporting application in Java with
team members, requiring encoding complex business logic about who
could view and edit appraisals and appraisal state transitions as Java
classes.</li>

<li>Reduced migration time from Zope to Confluence by transferring
content of one Wiki to another by writing a parser that converted data
format.</li>

<li>Added telescope performance metrics and associated metadata to
website through Perl program, allowing astronomers to view telescope
behavior over time.</li>

<li>Solved problem caused by reduction in Institute IP address range
by modifying Zope address handling to support subnet masking.</li>

<li>Generated photo gallery of Institute employees organized by
department on a nightly basis, produced by a Perl program from
information stored in LDAP and Active Directory.</li>

<li>Developed web-based phone directory application that searched
Active Directory for employees, becoming one of the most widely used
pages on site.</li>

<li>Kept astronomers informed of current research by writing
web-scraping script that reported when Institute astronomers had
uploaded preprints to Arxiv.</li>

<li>Maintained status of website links by writing link-checking
application, which parsed Apache log files and curatorsÂ’
webpage. Double-checked errors, emailing curators about them.</li>

<li>Supported and enhanced conference registration tool, resolving
problems during Institute conferences.</li>

<li>Performed code reviews, assessing other employees' software for
security vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Space Telescope Science Institute / Scientific Software Group<br />
Software Developer
</h3>

<p>Wrote applications and libraries supporting data files and formats
used by astronomical community to store and process observation
data.</p>

<uL>

<li>Added calibration files to database by assisting with designing
and writing Calibration Database system, including C code.</li>

<li>Initialized user environment for using astronomical software by
writing bash scripts and installing new software versions.</li>

<li>Wrote statistics package for astronomers, converting a
statistician's code into production quality code. Package allowed
astronomers to analyze data that was incomplete because of telescope
performance limits.</li>

<li>Designed and wrote synthetic photometry (synphot) package, a large
software package widely used by astronomers to plan proposed telescope
observations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>CGI Scripts</h3>



<p>I've created a <a href="https://github.com/Jinzang/cgi-scripts">new github
repository</a> for some short cgi
scripts I've written and plan to write. The focus is on simple scripts
for static sites. The first script is a search engine. I wrote the
first version ten years ago, but recently I rewrote the templating
code so it agrees with what I'm using now in followme and I added some
tests for the script.</p>
    

<p><a href="archive/cgi-scripts.html">Written on May 02, 2014</a></p>
<h3>One More Thing</h3>



<p>After compiling my todo list for followme yesterday, I remembered
there's one more module that needs to be written. I need a module that
will generate an rss or atom feed for recently changed files in a
directory. The most likely use is with together with the blog module
(App::Followme::CreateNews) but there's no reason it couldn't be used
for other folders. Which is why I'll write it as a separate module.</p>

<p>Followme loads and runs the modules that are listed in the
configuration file, which allows you to change the behavior of the
script without changing the code. Here's the source code for the
subroutine that loads and runs modules:</p>

<pre><code>sub load_and_run_modules {
    my ($self, $modules, $base_directory, $directory, %configuration) = @_;
    foreach my $module (@$modules) {
        eval "require $module" or die "Module not found: $module\n";
        $configuration{base_directory} = $base_directory;
        my $object = $module-&gt;new(\%configuration);
        $object-&gt;run($directory);
    }  
    return;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The trick for loading a module at run time is on the eval line. The
eval is necessary if the module name is not a bareword or a string
constant. The base directory is the directory containing the
configuration file, while the directory is what the module is being run
on. These can be the same or different, depending on which directory
followme is being run from.</p>

<h3>Plans For Followme</h3>


<p><a href="https://github.com/Jinzang/App-Followme">Followme</a> is the github
project I've been working on the most over the past several
months. I'm going to put it on hold for a while and turn to several
other projects. But just for the record, here is what I would like to
work on when I return to it. First, there needs to be more
documentation. The idea of a prototype and how it differs from a
template is something that needs explaining, as I haven't seen anyone
else using prototypes. Second, I'd like to add a photo gallery
module. I started work on one, but it's not finished. Third, I'd like
to expand the use of metadata variables. The usefulness of the
CreateIndex module depends on good metadata, such as author. Right now
there's no code to read metadata from binary files or html files and I
would like to add that. Right now the version of followme is one fix
ahead of the version on CPAN. It adds the filename to the error
message in one case where it was missing. If I don't come up with any
other fixes soon, I'll create another CPAN release before putting
followme to rest for a while.</p>
