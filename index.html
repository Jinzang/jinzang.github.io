<p>I'm Bernie Simon. The free software I've working on can be found
here on <a href="https://github.com/Jinzang">GitHub</a>. Some can also
be downloaded
from <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/JINZANG">CPAN.</a> The
software I have written was used to build this site. I created it with
<a href="https://github.com/Jinzang/App-Followme">followme</a>, a
static site generator I wrote as an alternative to Jekyll.

<h3>Filmore Update</h3>



<p>I've been coding for Project Filmore when I can find the time. So far,
the code needed to support the search engine script has been written,
though I have yet to do an end to end test of the search engine. Once
again, the plan with Project Filmore, is to provide a library and
collection of sample scripts for a (very) low end web hosting
environment, the sort of sites I do myself. It's a complement to
followme, which is a static website generator I use for this
site. While static websites are great, when you can complement them
with a few simple server side scripts, so much a better. So I'm
attempting to wrap up the code I've written over the past several
years into a single project. </p>

<h3>Project Filmore</h3>



<p>I'm writing some server side softer as a complement to followme, my
static website generator. I started out writing them as a series of
individual scripts, but the code duplication got to be too much. So
I'm rewriting the code in cgi-scripts as a collection of Perl modules
plus a thin top level script to invoke them, more or less the same
pattern I've used before. After I get the new libraries working, ther
will be a code cleanup, with App-Filmore replacing some of the older
projects that will be folded into it. But not Template-Twostep or
App-Followme, which are already on CPAN. No code yet on github. I'll
start it after I get the tests for at least a few of the modules
working. Why Filmore? The name was chosen at random and doesn't have
any special meaning.</p>

<h3>The NeoCities Api</h3>



<p>Here's another item for the TODO list for App::Followme. <a href="https://neocities.org/api">NeoCities 
now has an api</a> for uploading and deleting
files. Since NeoCities was one of the inspirations for writing
followme, I definitely want to support this by writing a new module for
followme .   </p>
